Ultimo
======

An interface framework for micropython built around asynchronous iterators.

Ultimo allows you to implement the logic of a micropython application
around a collection of asyncio Tasks that consume asynchronous iterators.

This is compared to the usual synchronous approach of having an infinite loop
that mixes together the logic for polling of the ADC and clock.

In addition to the code being simpler, this permits updates to be generated
and handled at different rates depending on the needs of the interaction.  For
example, the clock only needs to poll the time occasionally (since it is only
displaying hours and minutes) while the potentiometer needs to be checked
frequently if it is to be responsive to user interactions.

For example, to make a potentiometer control the duty cycle of an RGB LED
you might do something like::

    async def control_brightness(led, adc):
        async for value in adc:
            led.brightness(value >> 8)

while to output the current time to a 16x2 LCD, you might do::

    async def display_time(lcd, clock):
        async for dt in clock:
            value = b"{4:02d}:{5:02d}".format(dt)
            lcd.clear()
            lcd.write(value)

You can then combine these into a single application by creating Tasks in
a ``main`` function::

    async def main():
        led, lcd, adc, clock = initialize()
        brightness_task = asyncio.create_task(control_brightness(led, adc))
        display_task = asyncio.create_task(display_time(lcd, clock))
        # run forever
        await asyncio.gather(brightness_task, display_task)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

The ``ultimo`` library provides classes that simplify this paradigm.
There are classes which provide asynchronous iterators based around polling,
interrupts and asynchronous streams, as well as intermediate transforming
iterators that handle common tasks such as smoothing and de-duplication.
The basic Ultimo library is hardware-independent and should work on any
recent micropython version.

The ``ultimo_machine`` library provides hardware support wrapping
the micropython ``machine`` module and other standard library
modules.  It provides sources for simple polling of and interrupts from GPIO
pins, polled ADC, polled RTC and interrupt-based timer sources.

Ultimo also provides convenience decorators and a syntax for building pipelines
from basic building blocks using the bitwise-or (or "pipe" operator)::

    @pipe
    def denoise(value):
        """Denoise uint16 values to 6 significant bits."""
        return value & 0xfc00

    async def main():
        led_brightness = PollADC(26, 0.1) | denoise() | Dedup() | PWMSink(25)
        await asyncio.gather(led_brightness.create_task())
