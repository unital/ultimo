.. currentmodule:: ultimo

Ultimo allows you to implement the logic of a micropython application
around a collection of asyncio Tasks that consume asynchronous iterators.
This is compared to the usual synchronous approach of having a single main
loop that mixes together the logic for all the different activities that your
application carries out.

In addition to the making the code simpler, this permits updates to be
generated and handled at different rates depending on the needs of the
activity, so a user interaction, like changing the value of a potentiometer or
polling a button can happen in milliseconds, while a clock or temperature
display can be updated much less frequently.

For example, to make a potentiometer control the duty cycle of an RGB LED
you might do something like::

    async def control_brightness(led, adc):
        async for value in adc:
            led.brightness(value >> 8)

while to output the current time to a 16x2 LCD, you might do::

    async def display_time(lcd, clock):
        async for dt in clock:
            value = b"{4:02d}:{5:02d}".format(dt)
            lcd.clear()
            lcd.write(value)

You can then combine these into a single application by creating Tasks in
a ``main`` function::

    async def main():
        led, lcd, adc, clock = initialize()
        brightness_task = asyncio.create_task(control_brightness(led, adc))
        display_task = asyncio.create_task(display_time(lcd, clock))
        # run forever
        await asyncio.gather(brightness_task, display_task)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

What Ultimo Is
--------------

The :py:mod:`ultimo` library provides classes that simplify this paradigm.
There are classes which provide asynchronous iterators based around polling,
interrupts and asynchronous streams, as well as intermediate transforming
iterators that handle common tasks such as smoothing and de-duplication.
The basic Ultimo library is hardware-independent and should work on any
recent micropython version.

The :py:mod:`ultimo_machine` library provides hardware support wrapping
the micropython :py:mod:`machine` module and other standard library
modules.  It provides sources for simple polling of and interrupts from GPIO
pins, polled ADC, polled RTC and interrupt-based timer sources.

The :py:mod:`ultimo_display` library provides a framework for text-based
display of data, including an implementation that renders to a framebuffer.

Ultimo also provides convenience decorators and a syntax for building pipelines
from basic building blocks using the bitwise-or (or "pipe" operator)::

    @pipe
    def denoise(value):
        """Denoise uint16 values to 6 significant bits."""
        return value & 0xfc00

    async def main():
        led_brightness = PollADC(ADC_PIN_ID, 0.1) | denoise() | Dedup() | PWMSink(PWM_PIN_ID)
        await asyncio.gather(led_brightness.create_task())

What Ultimo Isn't
-----------------

Ultimo isn't intended for strongly constrained real-time applications, since
:py:mod:`asyncio` provides cooperative multitasking and gives no guarantees
about the frequency or latency with which a coroutine will be called.

The design goal of Ultimo was to make it easier to support user interactions,
so it may not be a good fit for applications which are purely for precision
hardware automation.

Why "Ultimo"?
-------------

Ultimo is a suburb of my hometown of Sydney which has historically been a hub
for science and technology: it is home to the University of Technology Sydney
and the Powerhouse Museum, and is where many Sydney start-ups are located.
